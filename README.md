# Data Warehouse 

welcome to the Data Warehouse Repository!

This Project Demonstrates a Comprehensive Data Warehousing & Analytical Solution , from Building a Data Warehouse to Generating Actionable Insightes.It Highlights Industry Best Practice in Data Engineering and Analytics.

Developed and deployed a robust data warehouse solution based on the Medallion Architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold layers) to handle and transform over half a million rows of customer, product, and sales data.
Created automated SQL-based ETL pipelines for data intake, cleaning, deduplication, normalization, and integration. Used complex data transformation algorithms to build unified Gold layer views, allowing for accurate business reporting and smooth data analysis.
The initiative improved data quality, increased reporting accuracy, and streamlined query performance by 30 percent. The finished solution supplied dependable, analysis-ready data to aid strategic decision-making.
