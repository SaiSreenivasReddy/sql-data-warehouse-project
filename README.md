# Data Warehouse 

welcome to the Data Warehouse Repository!

This project delivers a complete Data Warehousing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) solution using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to process and transform over half a million rows of customer, product, and sales data. Automated SQL-based ETL pipelines were developed for data ingestion, cleaning, deduplication, and normalization to ensure high data quality and optimized query performance. A detailed EDA was performed on the Gold layer to uncover key business metrics, customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using aggregation, ranking, and window functions. The project enables fast, reliable, and analysis-ready datasets for strategic business insights and reporting.

🏗️ Project Overview
Architecture: Implemented using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold layers) to ensure data quality, traceability, and scalability.

Data Volume: Processed and transformed over half a million rows of customer, product, and sales data.

ETL Pipelines: Designed and automated SQL-based ETL pipelines for:

Data ingestion

Cleaning and deduplication

Data normalization and integration

Schema standardization

Gold Layer: Built high-performance Gold layer views for accurate reporting and advanced analytics.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Gold layer to:

🗂️ Explore table schemas, key columns, and data types.

🌍 Understand customer demographics (countries, genders, age distribution).

🛍️ Analyze product hierarchies (categories, sub-categories, product names).

🕒 Perform date range and customer lifetime value analysis.

💰 Calculate key business metrics:

Total Sales

Total Quantity Sold

Number of Customers

Number of Products

Number of Orders

📊 Identify top/bottom performers:

Best-selling products and sub-categories

Highest and lowest revenue generators

Most and least active customers

🏆 Apply advanced ranking and window functions for Top-N and Bottom-N analyses.

The EDA provided critical insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance, supporting data-driven decision-making and further reporting.
